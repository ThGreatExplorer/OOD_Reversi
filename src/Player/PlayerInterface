The player interface will allow different types of players to interact with the controller and make
moves. Different types of players will be extensions of the player interface. This interface will
be a stub with two methods, the constructor and a "chooseMove".

The constructor will take an appendable as a parameter and save it. The appendable is connected to
the controller and lets the player pass choices to the controller.

The chooseMove will make/get move choice and pass it to the controller. For humans, this would
involve a scanner, while for an AI, this would be deciding a move. The move is then appended to the
appendable.
